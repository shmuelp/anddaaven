## AndDaaven 0.1.7 (first public release) ##

Initial screen, showing the tefilla picker.  Note that the Ma'ariv button is enlarged because it is at night.  Screenshot taken via Android emulator of Android 1.5.

Text from the beginning of Shacharit.  The screenshot is larger because it is emulating a Droid with a larger screen (Android 2.0.1).  The nikud is offset due to an Android rendering bug.  The nikud appears more correctly aligned with other fonts.  (FreeSans seems the best to me.)
