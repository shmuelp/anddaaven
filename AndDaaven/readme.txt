When the mouse is over a word, then its marks and vowels appear; when
the mouse moves away, they disappear leaving the letter text only.

The Hebrew text in this special HTML Tiqqun Qore'im is based on the
Aleppo Codex and the other early manuscripts that are close to it,
using the method of the Rav Mordechai Breuer, taken from our online
version at:

http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/cp/cp0.htm

adapted from our complete Hebrew Bible with cantillatin marks:

We also have online the Hebrew Bible with vowels but without
cantillation marks at:

Our Bibles conform completely to the RaMBaM's Laws of Torah Scrolls
Chapter 8's details on correct division of paragraphs (according to
the Yemenite manuscripts of Mishneh Torah, which differ from the usual
Vilna editon) and it is proper for a scribe to use them as the basis
for writing a kosher Torah scroll.
