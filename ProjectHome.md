AndDaaven strives to be a siddur application that is easy to use, and leverages the full capabilities of the Android platform.  A strong focus is ensuring that using the application should enhance tefilla, rather than distracting.

Note: AndDaaven is stable with basic features but many of the advanced features currently planned/envisioned are still being developed.

AndDaaven is freely [available](http://market.android.com/details?id=com.saraandshmuel.anddaaven) on the Android Market.
